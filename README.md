# What are design patterns?
* Design patterns are like reusable solutions for common problems in software design.
* Experienced developers, who figured out better ways to design software.
* General ideas or templates you can adapt to your specific problem.
* Not code, not algorithms: They don’t tell you exactly what code to write, but instead provide a way of thinking about problems.
* Problem-solving tools: They are approaches to tackle recurring problems in software design.
* Flexible and general: They can be applied across many types of software, like banking apps, games, or social media platforms.

# Why use design patterns?
* Shared wisdom: They are based on what has worked well for others in similar situations.
* Better design: They help you create software that's easier to maintain, extend, and understand.
  
# What are design principles?
Design principles are guidelines to help you create good object-oriented software. They are broader than design patterns and focus on avoiding bad designs, like systems that are:
Too rigid: Hard to change because everything is tightly connected.
Too fragile: Easily broken when something new is added.
Too complex: Difficult to understand and maintain.

# How are principles different from patterns?
Principles: General guidelines for improving design quality. They don’t give you a specific way to solve a problem but help you think about better ways to design.
Patterns: Proven, reusable solutions to common design problems. They are more specific and show you how to solve a particular problem.

# The big takeaway
Almost all design patterns rely on principles like "encapsulate what varies." These principles help you create designs that are adaptable and maintainable, while patterns give you concrete examples of how to achieve this.
