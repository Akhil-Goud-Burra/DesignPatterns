# What are design patterns?
* Design patterns are like reusable solutions for common problems in software design.
* Experienced developers, who figured out better ways to design software.
* General ideas or templates you can adapt to your specific problem.
* Not code, not algorithms: They donâ€™t tell you exactly what code to write, but instead provide a way of thinking about problems.
* Problem-solving tools: They are approaches to tackle recurring problems in software design.
* Flexible and general: They can be applied across many types of software, like banking apps, games, or social media platforms.

# Why use design patterns?
* Shared wisdom: They are based on what has worked well for others in similar situations.
* Better design: They help you create software that's easier to maintain, extend, and understand.
